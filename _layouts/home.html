<p><span style="color:blue"><em>I am currently looking for internship opportunities, 
  for summer 2024, preferably software engineering.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  I am a 1<sup>rd</sup> year graduate student at University of Virginia. I am broadly interested in compilers,
  programming languages and high-performance computing. My current research focuses on 
  compile-time optimizations for sparse tensor algebra computations.
