I am Anushka Idamekorala, a graduate student at University of Virginia, working with world-renowned [Prof. Geoffery Fox]({{"https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/geoffrey-c-fox"}}). I am broadly interested in systems, distributed computing and deep learning. My current research focuses on privacy preserving machine learning.

I received my Honors Degree of Bachelor of Science Honors in Engineering (B.Sc.(Hons.) in Engineering) from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka
where I completed my thesis on V2V vehicle platooning implementation for highways(simulation study) under the advisement of
[Dr. Tharaka Samarasinghe]({{"https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-tharaka-samarasinghe/"}}).

Upon graduation, before starting my graduate studies, I worked as a software engineer for a couple of years in several prominent companies including Sysco LABS (Engineering arm of Sysco Corporation), Singapore Management University, PickMe, 
Novatti (ASX:NOV). These experiences have allowed me to work on diverse projects and collaborate with talented teams, further enhancing my technical capabilities. In addition to my technical skills, I am dedicated to ensuring smooth production environments and promptly resolving any issues that may arise. I thrive in dynamic and challenging work environments that encourage innovation and growth.
